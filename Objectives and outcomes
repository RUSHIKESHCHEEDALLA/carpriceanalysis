Objectives of the project:
1. To analyze and visualize the relationship between various attributes (features) of cars and their prices.
2. To identify key factors that influence car prices.
3. To create interactive and informative visualizations to facilitate exploration and understanding of the data.
4. To develop a predictive model to estimate car prices based on input attributes.
5. To evaluate the performance of the predictive model using appropriate metrics.
Outcomes of the project:
1. Interactive dashboards and visualizations to explore car price trends and patterns.
2. Identification of top factors influencing car prices (e.g., make, model, year, mileage, features).
3. A predictive model to estimate car prices with a high degree of accuracy.
4. Insights into market demand and supply dynamics.
5. Recommendations for car buyers and sellers based on data-driven analysis.
6. A comprehensive report detailing the methodology, findings, and conclusions.
7. A data visualization story that communicates the key insights and outcomes.
